**This is an exploratory analysis of the Import and Export by India from 2014 to 2017 dataset, which can be found** [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rajanand/import-and-export-by-india).

#### It is a belief that a country with maxmimun exports then imports is performing well economically,

#### And again it doen't make sense to make everthing on your own .If you trade with other countries that have a compartive advantage.

#### Oh, confusing right!! Easy, Top imports are Ores and minerals then comes manufactured goods.

#### Within Ores and minerals, petroleum and petroleum products are big share. To strengthen indian economy

#### taxes on this product are high, which limits people to use them more, demand gets down, so as import can be reduced.

#### And then next major category is manufactured goods, MAKE IN INDIA is a solution.
#### When goods are manufaced in indian reduces imports, creats employment opportunity which boosts economy.

##Net Exports

Net exports are the difference between a country's total value of exports and total value of imports. Depending on whether a country imports more goods or exports more goods, net exports can be a positive or negative value.




```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}


import_total <- import  %>%
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(value = sum(value))

import_total$type<- "imports" # for reference

export_total <- export  %>%
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(value1 = sum(value))

export_total$type <- "exprots"  # for reference

temp2 <-cbind(import_total, export_total)

temp2$value3 <- temp2$value1 - temp2$value  # Net_ export value

temp2<-temp2[-c(2:6)]
colnames(temp2)[2] <- "value" #to make column name unique for 3 tables

temp2$type<- "Net_exports"  # for reference

colnames(export_total)[2] <- "value" #to make column name unique for 3 tables
import_total
export_total
temp2

temp1 <-rbind(import_total, export_total, temp2 )

```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library('ggplot2')

temp1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, value, color = type)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  labs(x = "year", y = "value in Million USD")+
  geom_abline(x=0, colour = "black") 

```


From graph it show that Net Export are in negative, which means India Imports more then its Exports. 
And Net Export value are getting positive every year form 2014-2016.



### **Summary and a bit Economics**

####1. Most imports are from china and we import manufactured goods, why cant we make them here?
####2. Most exports are to USA and U ArabEmts. Manufactured goods, Textile, Chemical industry are max exports, Lets focused to produce more and exports this products with best cost.
####3. Most imported products - petroleum and petroleum products, Something every Indian has to think. Why to get your 4-wheeler out when you are travelling alone, if its short distance travel, have bi-cycle ride or go by walk, it's good for you health
####4. If we can make anything cost effectively, without harming environment better make them in India.
####5. And Gold, Indian Women’s are most beautiful, why to buy gold. IF you are lookin for investment buy E- Gold.


#### When every i hear about Exports and imports, **farmville game** comes to my mind.

####**Make/Grow/Produce things in you land and consume, sell excess to make money.**
