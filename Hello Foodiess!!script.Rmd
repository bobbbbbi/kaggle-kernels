##Hello Foodies,



##This kernal is an exploratory analysis of the KCBS Barbeque Competitions, which can be found [Click Here](https://www.kaggle.com/jaysobel/kcbs-bbq).
 
 
 
#Introductions  

**Kansas City Barbeque Society** is a competitive cooking organization founded in 1985 by Carolyn and Gary Wells and Rick Welch. Their desire was to put together a local group for competitive barbecue. It has since grown exponentially and provides oversight to hundreds of competitions. It is the largest competitive barbecue organization in the world, with more than 15,000 members.


The Kansas City Barbeque Society is the official sanctioning body of competitive barbeque. Each year, KCBS sanctions more than 500 competitions across the country.
Competitions are usually coordinated in conjunction with a local festival or event. Teams typically begin to arrive on a Friday morning and set up their equipment. Competitors will begin to cook on Friday evening and then throughout the night with a turn in for the various smoked meats some time in the early afternoon on Saturday.

Events usually have a cash prize of varying amounts. Quite often these events draw crowds of spectators numbering in the thousands, and depending on the prize amount, they will draw competitors from several states.

In 2011, KCBS partnered with Sam's Club to offer the largest and richest competition in barbeque history. The Inaugural Sam's Club National Barbecue Tour consists of 20 local qualifying events, five regional events and one national championship. Teams will be competing to win a piece of the $400,000 prize purse.

##Is the competition a 'standard championship' !!
If the competition consists of and only of the four categories: chicken, pork ribs, pork and brisket.- **Yes**
If the competition include extra categories like dessert and these are considered - **No**

## where do KCBS competitions happen more fequently{#competitionsfrequently}

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
contest$state_full<-sapply(contest$state_full,tolower) # Changing State full name to lower case

most_happening <- contest %>%

With the name KCBS Compititions happens more in  **missouri, kansas states**.


## Money Money !!{#Money}

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

big_prize_money <- contest %>% 
  group_by(state_full) %>% 
  summarise(avg_prize= round(mean(prize, na.rm = TRUE) , digits=0)) %>%

datatable(big_prize_money, class="table-condensed", style="bootstrap", options = list(dom = 'tp'))


```


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE }

```

But when it comes to Average prize money, **Arkansas and Nevada states** pays big.

###Lets see which team has Average best score in - brisket, chicken, pork, ribs respectively{.tabset}

#### **Brisket**

```{r, result='asis'}

brisket_results <- results_brisket %>%
    group_by(team_name) %>% 
    summarise(score = round(mean(score, na.rm = TRUE) , digits=4))%>%
    arrange(desc(score))


kable(head(brisket_results, 20))


```

ohh 180 on for 'BENT NAIL BBQ', 'Ghost River Smok-a-Holics' ,'The Dynamic Duo Bruce/Kyle' teams

#### **Chicken**

```{r, result='asis'}
chicken_results <- results_chicken %>%
    group_by(team_name) %>% 
    summarise(score = round(mean(score, na.rm = TRUE) , digits=4))%>%
    arrange(desc(score))
kable(head(chicken_results, 20))

``` 

ohh 180 on 180 for 'Hackers n Hogs BBQ','R-W-Que','Smoke Central' teams


#### **Pork**

```{r, result='asis'}
pork_results <- results_pork%>%
    group_by(team_name) %>% 
    summarise(score = round(mean(score, na.rm = TRUE) , digits=4))%>%
    arrange(desc(score))

kable(head(pork_results, 20))

``` 

ohh 180 on 180 for 'Goldie Locks & the Three Pigs','Rejino Barbecue','Slabba Dabba Que BBQ','Smokey Adams Bar-b-que' teams


#### **Ribs**

```{r, result='asis'}
ribs_results <- results_ribs%>%
    group_by(team_name) %>% 
    summarise(score = round(mean(score, na.rm = TRUE) , digits=4))%>%
    arrange(desc(score))
kable(head(ribs_results, 20))


``` 

No team has 180 on 180 unlike brisket, chicken, pork . I think judges expects more from compititors





```{r include=FALSE}
options(tibble.width = Inf)
```


###Lets see what is teams best scores - brisket, chicken, pork, ribs respectively{.tabset}

#### **Brisket**

```{r, result='asis'}

temp <- results_brisket %>%
arrange(desc(score))


datatable(temp, class="table-condensed", style="bootstrap", options = list(dom = 'tp'))


```

many teams scored 180 on 180 


#### **Chicken**

```{r, result='asis'}
temp <- results_chicken %>%
arrange(desc(score))

datatable(temp, class="table-condensed", style="bootstrap", options = list(dom = 'tp'))


``` 

many teams scored 180 on 180 


#### **Pork**

```{r, result='asis'}
temp <- results_pork %>%
arrange(desc(score))

datatable(temp, class="table-condensed", style="bootstrap", options = list(dom = 'tp'))

``` 


#### **Ribs**

```{r, result='asis'}
temp <- results_ribs %>%
arrange(desc(score))

datatable(temp, class="table-condensed", style="bootstrap", options = list(dom = 'tp'))

``` 

many teams scored 180 on 180 


##When do competition happens !!{#Whendocompetitionhappens}

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Extracting day/month/year from time stamp  

contest$date <- as.POSIXct(strptime(contest$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d"))
contest$day <- as.integer(format(contest$date, "%d")) # day
contest$month<- as.factor(format(contest$date, "%m")) # month
contest$year <- as.integer(format(contest$date, "%Y")) # year

```

#Lets see on which day competition happen more

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
contest %>%
    group_by(day)%>%
    summarise(n = n())%>%
    ggplot(aes(x =day, y =  n )) +
    geom_bar(stat='identity',colour="white", fill = c("red")) 

```

I dont see any relation with day to competition 



#Lets see on which month competition happen more

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

contest %>%
    group_by(month)%>%
    summarise(n = n())%>%
    ggplot(aes(x = month, y =  n )) +
    geom_bar(stat='identity',colour="white", fill = c("red")) 

```

Most of competition happens between **April - October** , most much in **November - March** , **September** is highest


#Lets see on which year competition happen more

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

contest %>%
    group_by(year)%>%
    summarise(n = n())%>%
    ggplot(aes(x = year, y =  n )) +
    geom_bar(stat='identity',colour="white", fill = c("red")) 

```

I dont see any relation with year to competition, 2013 is low because of data.








```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#combining results_brisket,results_chicken,results_pork,results_ribs.

combined_result <- rbind(results_brisket,results_chicken,results_pork,results_ribs)


Total_score<-combined_result %>% 
  group_by(contest_key, team_name) %>% 
  summarise(tscore =sum(score))  %>% 
  data.frame() %>%
  arrange(contest_key, desc(tscore))
  
datatable(Total_score, class="table-condensed", style="bootstrap", options = list(dom = 'tp'))

```


##Number of team participated in contest.{#Numberofteam}
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
participants <- Total_score %>%
  group_by(contest_key)%>%
  summarise(No_of_teams = n())

datatable(participants, class="table-condensed", style="bootstrap", options = list(dom = 'tp'))
rm(participants)
gc()

```

## Lets see Number of apperence by a team in contest

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

number_of_apperance <- Total_score %>%
  group_by(team_name)%>%
  summarise(appearances = n())%>%
arrange(desc(appearances))
datatable(number_of_apperance, class="table-condensed", style="bootstrap", options = list(dom = 'tp'))
```

## Which team is over all best team 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
avg_total_team_score <- Total_score %>%
  group_by(team_name)%>%
  summarise(appearances = n(), avg_total_score = mean(tscore))%>%
  arrange(desc(avg_total_score))
datatable(avg_total_team_score, class="table-condensed", style="bootstrap", options = list(dom = 'tp'))
```

Looking total score out off 800, How Yammmmi food that one should have tasted !!!
